My AHK script to use with any working env (based on italian layout)

## A bit of history:

I started this script while trying to declutter my work-desk, as i needed more space for papers and blueprints. First step was to go for a bluetooth ergonomic foldable keyboard, and i settled for [this](https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B07BNB6R7G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1)
It was good (still is), short stroke, low encumbrance, and i was able to move it around the desk with no problem. At the time that was what i needed. Added a few combinations of accented characters and the "ø", very useful to write technical mails.

Than I changed job, and since in a lot of working environments you don't get taken seriously, if you bring with yourself a lot o strange/ergonomic stuff, i had to go back to a horrible 5€ keyboard. Since then I started taking coding seriously, and i need characters to be at hand and started to expand the script.

I added the "double stroke capslock" I copied it from a forum (when in find it back ill give it credits), and the l,k ┗ ┣ to make better readmes.

I will continue updating it.

## Next fixes:

- ```
  UTF-8 still gives some problems
  ┗ partially solved with .exe export, not a real solution
  ```
